How do I make my first React project?
Install Node.js
Make sure you install the LTS version, the current one might work but I myself have had issues with it. You can find the link to download Node.js right here, here.

Open Your Desktop
From your desktop, rightclick into the vast nothingness and open a terminal. Here you will write the following below to make a new folder called code.


COPY

COPY

COPY

COPY

COPY
mkdir code
Tip. Have 1 folder for all your projects to minimize a messy desktop. Then you will navigate to the code folder with the command below.


COPY

COPY

COPY

COPY

COPY

COPY
cd code
And now you're ready to make your first React project by using the following command below. Replace the project-name with what you desire.


COPY

COPY

COPY

COPY

COPY

COPY
npx create-react-app project-name
This will create a new folder with the project name, and use the create-react-app template, now you're ready. Use the following command below.


COPY

COPY

COPY

COPY

COPY

COPY
cd project-name
Then run the app with the last command.

npm run start
This will open the react-template created.

What now Well now that you've created your first app, you're ready to learn how to use React! The absolute best way to learn React is to be independent and make your own projects. This tutorial playlist by NetNinja on YouTube blew me away and is great for anyone starting on React . Give it a go!
Good luck.
